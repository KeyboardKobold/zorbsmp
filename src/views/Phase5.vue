        <h4>ZorbSMP Java Server Rules</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't be an ass wipe. There is a difference between rivalry and being a dick, if someone is getting upset by your actions and you continue, I'll wack you with the ban hammer. This includes things like:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Excessive and unprovoked griefing on bases.</li>
                    <li>Unnecessary amounts of damage on peoples bases.</li>
                    <li>Not filling in creeper holes you made on someone else's base (you monster).</li>
                    <li>Spawn camping/Combat logging.</li>
                    <li>Stealing excessively and/or valuable things.</li>
                    <li>Portal trapping.</li>
                    <li>Nothing discriminatory.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Please don't hack, there is no way me or the admins can prevent it unless your caught, so we trust that you wont.</li>
                <li>Bosses are not a server event anymore, just be nice and tell others you are doing it so people who want the first kill can come along and join in.</li>
                <li>Raids mostly occur on accident however, if someone has claimed/owns that village it is up to them whether or not you may participate and get loot from the raid. Triggering raids offensively/Intentionally is allowed.</li>
                <li>Try not to rush to full netherite in the first day, there is no punishment however I don't want the server exhausted again in the first week, chill and build some huge cocks or something idk.</li>
                <li>Exploring is fine ofc but don't travel ridiculously far so that you are never seen again by another player. I can't stress this enough, I want to see your builds! If its has a coord of more than 750 in the nether I'll fuckin clone your base into spawn.</li>
                <li>Try not to make huge teams like Birmingham or hurghada which dominated the world lmao.</li>
                <li>Raids mostly occur on accident however, if someone has claimed/owns that village it is up to them whether or not you may participate and get loot from the raid. Triggering raids offensively/Intentionally is allowed.</li>
